## Writing transformations

To start writing transformations, select the column on which you wish to perform a transformation and choose ```Edit cells->Transformâ€¦```. In the screen that displays you have a place to write a transformation (the 'Expression' box) and then the ability to Preview the effect the transformation would have on 10 rows of your data.

The transformation you type into the 'Expression' box has to be a valid GREL expression. The simplest expression is simply the word 'value' by itself - which simply means the value that is currently in the column - that is: make no change.

GREL functions are written by giving a value of some kind (a text string, a date, a number etc.) to a GREL function. Some GREL functions take additional parameters or options which control how the function works. GREL supports two types of syntax:

* ```value.function(options)```
* ```function(value, options)```

Either is valid, and which is used is completely down to personal preference. In these notes the first syntax is used.

Next to the 'Preview' option are options to view:

* 'History' - a list of transformations you've previously used with the option to reuse them immediately or to 'star' them for easy access
* 'Starred' - a list of transformations you've 'starred' via the 'History' view
* 'Help' - a list of all the GREL functions and brief information on how to use them

>## Changing Separators Between Values
>Let's create a text facet for the 'Keywords' column 
>Use Facets and the GREL expression ```value.replace()``` to replace the commas by semi-colons
>1. Click the dropdown menu on the 'Keywords' column
>2. Choose ```Edit cells->Transform...```
>3. In the Expression box type ```value.replace(",",";")```. This expression tells OpenRefine to replace the comma by a semi-colon.
>4. In the Preview pane you can see what the effect of running this will be.
>5. Click ```OK``` and pay attention to the notification indicating the number of transformations performed.

>## Challenge (DOAJ_big)
>What is the most frequent individual `Subject` among the journals listed in the dataset?
>Use `facetting`, perform `transformation` and `common transformation`, as well as the `splitting` function to come up with a solution. Tip: we do not want to differentiate subject levels. Take a close look at the different separators present in this column and think about how you can remove them.
>>## Solution
>>1. Create a text facet for the 'Subject' column
>>2. Notice that top-level subjects are separated by vertical bars `|` and same level by periods `.`, and colons `:` for sub-topics
>>3. We'll need to perform transformations to remove these different separators. We'll separate all of them by semi-colons `;`
3.1 value.replace("|", ";")
3.2 value.replace(".", ";")
3.3 value.replace(":", ";")
>>You can also combine the three separate steps above into one expression. Note that you don't have to type `value` multiple times: `value.replace("|", ";").replace(".", ";").replace(":", ";")` 
>>4. Use de function split multi-valued cells using the semi-colons `;` as the separator
>>5. Apply common transformations to remove unwanted spaces so you won't have similar values unclustered.
>>6. Sort the facet by `count`
>>7. Which subject has more counts? Answer: **Agriculture** if you are using the US subset, or **Medicine** if your are using the whole dataset.

## Filling Out Blank Cells
Another useful GREL expression is the conditional function `if`. Let's say you want to fill out all blanks from the `Digital Archiving` column with N/A (non-applicable). In that case, you will can type the following expression in the transformation pane: `if(value==blank,"new",value)` and replace 
"new" by N/A. 
>*Important tip: You can also apply this transformation to as many columns you wish, by selecting the first column `All>Transform` typing the expression, then `ok`, select the columns and `ok`.*

>## Challenge
> What would be an alternative path to perform the same transformation?
>>## Solution 
>>`Perform Text Facet > Edit Blanks`
